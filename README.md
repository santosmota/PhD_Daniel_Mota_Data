## Folder: PythonCharts
Python scripts for generating the figures in the thesis. 

A rough structure of the files is given below:

    - Intro_FreqRespPhases.py: figure in Chapter 2 - Background
    - ChHESS_*: figures in Chapter 3 - Control Structures for ESSs
    - ChPEC_*: figures in Chapter 4 - Current Control in Power Converters, also in Appendix E - Frequency Adaptive DSC
    - ChFreq_*: figures in Chapter 5 - Sharing of Primary Reserves
    - ChPHIL_*: figures in Chapter 6 - Scaling Method for PHIL Test Beds
    
Some files have not made the cut and stayed out of the thesis. 

## Folder: Modelos
The subfolders located in here contain model and raw-data used for generating figures in the thesis.

A rough structure of the subfolders is given below:

    - Modelos/Intro/ : figure in Chapter 2 - Background
    - Modelos/ChHESS/ : figures in Chapter 3 - Control Structures for ESSs
    - Modelos/ChPEC/ : figures in Chapter 4 - Current Control in Power Converters, also in Appendix E - Frequency Adaptive DSC
    - Modelos/PrimReserveSharing* : figures in Chapter 5 - Sharing of Primary Reserves
    - Modelos/ChPHIL/ : figures in Chapter 6 - Scaling Method for PHIL Test Beds

Some folders have not made the cut and stayed out of the thesis.
